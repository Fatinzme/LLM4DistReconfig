Prompt for Distribution System Power Restoration:
Objective: Determine the optimal set of switches to open/close(Always keep faulted lines isolated by setting status=0), restoring maximum load demand while maintaining a radial topology without overloads or voltage violations.

Input Processing Instructions:
1.Process fault objects first:
* Open all lines with status=1 around fault's location (isolation)
* Add fault-altered lines to inputs
2.Line types: Only modify type=S (switch) elements. type=L lines cannot be switched.
3. Source constraints: For each enabled VSource (status=1), Total connected load (P,Q) must not exceed "Capacity". Use default 10,000kVA if unspecified.
4. Voltage constraints: All energized buses must satisfy Vminpu ≤ V ≤ Vmaxpu. Default [0.8,1.1] p.u. applies where unspecified.
5.Topology requirement: Post-restoration network must be a single radial tree connecting enabled VSources to loads.

Output Requirements:List switches with changed status

Key Analysis Steps to Perform:
1.Fault Isolation: Enforce status=0 on lines tagged by active faults (fault.status=1)
2.Feasibility Check: Verify if VSources can support restored loads
3.Radial Validation: Determine all connected components and ensure in every components number of its bus minus number of it lines which status=1 equals 1.
4.Violation Checking: Iterate until no overloaded sources or out-of-limit voltages exist

Terminate if:
No feasible radial configuration meets voltage constraints
All candidate solutions overload sources
