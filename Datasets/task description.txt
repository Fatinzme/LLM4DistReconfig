Prompt for Distribution System Power Restoration:
Objective: Determine the optimal set of switches to open/close(Always keep faulted lines isolated by setting status=0), restoring maximum load demand while maintaining a radial topology without overloads or voltage violations.

Output Requirements:List switches with changed status using following json format
{
 "success":true/false,
 "action":[List switches with changed status],
 "supply_Vsource":{
	list buses followed by Vsource supplying each of them.
	if a bus is not supplyed by any Vsource, set its value to "offline"
 }
}

Key Analysis Steps to Perform:
1.Fault Isolation: Enforce status=0 on lines tagged by active faults (fault.status=1)
2.Feasibility Check: Verify if VSources can support restored loads
3.Radial Validation: Determine all connected components and ensure in every components number of its bus minus number of it lines which status=1 equals 1.

Terminate if:
No feasible radial configuration meets voltage constraints
All candidate solutions overload sources

Set "success" when find feasible configuration. If terminated, set "success" to false.
